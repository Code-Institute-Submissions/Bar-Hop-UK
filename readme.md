Problems - had a problem getting the images to be the correct size in the different city vards that I got from bootstrap. solved 
solved this by seeting a height with in each of the image.


My Idea

Craft beer has become a major buismess as people want to drink bootique and locally sourced beer more and more. Many new beweries 
are opening up every year, and they are opening up in or near built up areas having taprooms attatched to the brewy allowing them 
to sell thier product on site.

1. Being in or around a bulit up area gives you an immediate customer base.
2. It allows you to get the name of your product out with out having an obsurd marketing budget.
3. Having the tap room attatched to brewery lets you turn extar space into a revenue source.

This gave me the idea of making an app that was deticated to letting you know the closest breweries to you currebt location and of the 
breweries operating in larger towns in the UK, with a view of setting up a service that would take people on tours of the breweries.

What the user wants



1. As a user I want to be able navigate across the site with ease.
2. As a user I want to be able to find out what facilities the site has to offer.
3. 


I wanted to make the site accesable and straight to the point as It is desighned to be used for people on teh go and most likely with 
there hand held device. To to this I did not want to add to many options and links in the beginning, extar fascets to the site are planned to 
be implemted later.

Design 

I made the App using teh [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework fro a responsive framework, this worked especially well as I envisioned
this to be an app mainly ised on poratble devices.

Fonts

The main font I settled on was [Bangers](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bangers), I felt it gave a playful alomst comic book look which I liked
and felt a theme based around fun and good times would work for an app that was in a sense promotng good times.
