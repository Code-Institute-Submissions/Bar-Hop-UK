My Idea

Craft beer has become a major buismess as people want to drink bootique and locally sourced beer more and more. Many new beweries 
are opening up every year, and they are opening up in or near built up areas having taprooms attatched to the brewy allowing them 
to sell thier product on site.

1. Being in or around a bulit up area gives you an immediate customer base.
2. It allows you to get the name of your product out with out having an obsurd marketing budget.
3. Having the tap room attatched to brewery lets you turn extra space into a revenue source.

This gave me the idea of making an app that was deticated to letting you know the closest breweries to you currebt location and of the 
breweries operating in larger towns in the UK, with a view of setting up a service that would take people on tours of the breweries.

What the user wants



1. I wanted the app to be esily navigated for the user. As this would generally result in repeat custom.
2. I wanted the functioms of the app to be dispayed well and easily accesable. Again people will get bore d with things taht are over complicated fpr no reason.
3. I wanted all the functions on the app to be user friendly an enjpyable.



I wanted to make the site accesable and straight to the point as It is desighned to be used for people on the go and most likely with 
there hand held device. To to this I did not want to add to many options and links in the beginning, extar fascets to the site are planned to 
be implemted later.

##Design 

I made the App using teh [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework fro a responsive framework, this worked especially well as I envisioned
this to be an app mainly used on poratble devices.

###Fonts

The main font I settled on was [Bangers](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bangers), I felt it gave a playful alomst comic book look which I liked
and felt a theme based around fun and good times would work for an app that was in a sense promotng good times.


###Colours 

I wanted the colour theme to be based around light and fun, Bar Hop Uk being a fun app I wanted this comethrough in the design and colour. I wanted a pop arty 
comic book colour theme. I originally did look at using colour assosiated with beer an hops and did trial some colours of that scheme but found them a bit to earthy
and not fitting inwith my scope of the app.

Logo's 

I used to loos through out the appin keeping with the comic esque theme. Both of the logos had anchor tags that linked backed to the home page. I used the website 
[Canva] {https://www.canva.com/} to design the logos.

Problems

I had  a problem with my modal newsletter pop up, when the newspaper logo which had a transform scale from .9 - 2 ws activated it would push the modal off 
screen on some of the smaller devices. I fixed ths by changing the transform scale to .5 - 1. still giving me the affect I desired but the transform was smaller
and more controlled, which along whith sorting out my placemant issue also looke better asthetically.

##Testing

For testing I used the [goggle chrome devolpment tools][https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools] to test the app on a 
variety of screen sizes.

##Wireframe

For my wireframes I first usd pen and paper to jot down my original thoughts and then once I had a clearer picture in my head of 
how I wanted the app to look I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to mock it up. The deign did change from the pen and pad to balsamiq 
to actual coding as certain things did not look at good as I hoped, but overall it sayed pretty much the same.
